#### Tools && Ecosystem

`cgo` - Cgo enables the creation of Go packages that call C code.  
`cover` - Cover is a program for creating and analyzing the coverage profiles generated by "go test -coverprofile".  
`fix` - Fix finds Go programs that use old features of the language and libraries and rewrites them to use newer ones.  
`fmt` - Fmt formats Go packages, it is also available as an independent gofmt command with more general options.  
`godoc` - Godoc extracts and generates documentation for Go packages.  
`vet` - Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string.

Go structures instead of Objects.

```go
type demo struct {
  name string
  id   int
}

func(d *demo) getName() string {
  return t.name
}

func(d *demo) setID(newID int) {
  t.id = newID
}

func(d *demo) getID() int {
  return d.id
}
```
